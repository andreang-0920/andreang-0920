Hi everyone, I am Andre. I am an 18 year old Actuarial Science student from Heriot-Watt University Malaysia.

I started my coding journey using Java, and I learned Web Development a few months later.

I am currently learning SQL and Python.

I enjoy learning to code and reading newsletters.

I am glad to connect with you at Twitter & Instagram (@andrelouis920).
